Any additional company or contact context that might be useful for crafting a relevant sales message\n\n## Guidelines:\n- Your response should be **detailed, structured, and accurate**\n- You are writing **for another AI**, so don't hold back on context \u2014 more is better\n- You can assume the contact already  know about 82Labs and it's capabilities, and more interested in knowing how to improve his KPIs and company using it's services.\n- Write in **natural language**, using clear, concise, informative sentences \u2014 not marketing fluff or speculation\n- Keep your tone objective and analytical\n- Avoid repeating generic phrases like \u201cthe company is innovative\u201d unless supported by facts\n\n## Inputs:\n- From user prompt\n- From Explorium MCP tools\n\n## Output Structure:\nReturn your findings in 2-3 clear paragraphs. The first paragraph should describe the **main use case to solve in the company in detail** and explain why it may be relevant. The second should summarize what the **company does** and any other useful GTM signals (size, growth stage, recent changes, priorities, etc.).\n\nNow generate the research summary.\n"
